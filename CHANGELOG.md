## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository scaffolding (Phase 0): MIT license, README with problem statement
  and roadmap, Makefile (`build`, `test`, `lint`, `up`, `down`, `bench`),
  `golangci-lint` v2 configuration, and a GitHub Actions CI pipeline running
  build, `go test -race`, and lint on every push and pull request.
- `cmd/pgpilot` entrypoint skeleton.
- Local development cluster (Phase 1): a `docker-compose.yml` bringing up one
  Postgres 16 primary and two streaming replicas over real physical
  replication, with dedicated replication slots, a seeded test schema, and a
  standby bootstrap via `pg_basebackup`. `make up` produces a working cluster
  and `make smoke` asserts that a row written to the primary is replayed and
  served by both replicas. Rationale recorded in
  `docs/adr/0001-dev-cluster-replication.md`.
